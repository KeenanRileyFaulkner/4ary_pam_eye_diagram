The attached script creates an eye diagram for a 4-ary PAM system with the specified params.
To install and run the script (in Linux):
1. Clone the repo and `cd` into the root directory of the project 
1. Use make to create a virtual environment and install dependencies: `make install`
1. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`

That's it! Run the script with `python 4_ary_pam_eye.py`. It will produce a png with the required eye diagram.
